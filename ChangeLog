	* autodafe: BUG0004: Sometime, the packet sent (in client and
	server mode) must be flushed. the client_fuzz() and server_fuzz()
	functions in network.c have been modified to send TCP_NODELAY
	(avoid the Nagle algorithm).
	Thanks to Adam Baldwin <adam_baldwin at ngenuity-is dot com>
	
	* adc: BUG0003: When a line is terminated by "\r\n", the "\r" is
	not detected and an "unknown character" error is sent. This is
	problematic when the AD script is written on Microsoft
	Windows. Now "\r\n" and "\n" are correcty parsed.

	* pdml2ad: BUG0002: The size value should written in hexadecimal
	and not decimal (comments generated by pdml2ad).

	* pdml2ad: BUG0001: Sometimes the variable value exported by PDML
	does not give the correct size e.g. "0001" is converted in "1".
	For example the DHCP module has this problem. Now pdml2ad verify
	if the size of the value is correct and modify the variable if
	not.
